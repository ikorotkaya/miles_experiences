# Limited location access to Berlin

This application uses the user's location to display processing times and estimated directions. However, it is only designed for use within Berlin. 

Therefore, the application will only work if the user is located within the boundaries of Berlin: if the user is located more than 50 kilometres from Berlin, the application will resort to using the default location of Alexanderplatz.

If the user allows location access within their web browser, the application will use this information and the car icon will be positioned at the user's location. 

Conversely, if location access is denied, the car icon will be placed at the default location.
